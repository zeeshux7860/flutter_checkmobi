## Installation

1. Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_checkmobi:

```

2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the plugin.

## Platform Support

- Android

## Usage

To use the plugin, follow these steps:

### 1. Set API Key
Before using any feature of the plugin, you need to set the API key provided by Checkmobi.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_checkmobi/flutter_checkmobi.dart';

void setApiKey(String apiKey) {
  FlutterCheckmobi.setApiKey(apiKey);
}
```

### 2. Initialize and Start Verification
To initialize and start the phone number verification process, call the `callIInitialize` method with the required parameters:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_checkmobi/flutter_checkmobi.dart';

void startVerification(String phoneNumber, String countryCode) {
  FlutterCheckmobi.callIInitialize(
    phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
    countryCode: countryCode,
  ).then((result) {
    print('Verification process started: $result');
  }).catchError((error) {
    print('Error: $error');
  });
}
```

### 3. Check User Status
To check whether the user has been verified, use the `checkUser` method. It returns the phone number and server ID if verified.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_checkmobi/flutter_checkmobi.dart';

void checkUser() {
  FlutterCheckmobi.checkUser().then((result) {
    print('Verified User: $result');
  }).catchError((error) {
    print('Error: $error');
  });
}
```

## Methods

### `setApiKey`
Sets the API key for the Checkmobi SDK.

**Arguments:**
- `api_key` (String) - The API key provided by Checkmobi.

**Usage:**
```dart
FlutterCheckmobi.setApiKey('your-api-key');
```

### `callIInitialize`
Starts the phone number verification process.

**Arguments:**
- `phoneNumber` (String) - The phone number to verify.
- `countryCode` (String) - The country code of the phone number.

**Returns:** 
- A result indicating whether the verification process started successfully.

### `checkUser`
Checks whether the user has been verified.

**Returns:**
- A JSON string containing the phone number and server ID if the user is verified.


###  Listening for Data
You can listen for data, including any errors or verification events, using the `listenForData` method.

```dart
dataRetrive.listenForData(
  onComplete: (val) {
    print(val); // Log the verification result.
  },
  onData: (val) {},
  onError: (val) {
    print(val); // Handle error
    Fluttertoast.showToast(msg: val); // Display error message
  },
  onnVerifyPin: (val) {},
);
```

## Errors

- `401`: API key not set.
- `404`: Account not found.
- `409`: An error occurred during the user verification process.



### Key Methods in the Example:

- **`setApiKey`**: Sets the API key for Checkmobi.
- **`createMissedCall`**: Starts the phone number verification process via missed call.
- **`listenForData`**: Listens for events like verification completion or errors.

## Error Handling

- If the API key is not set correctly, errors will be shown in the console.
- Any verification errors are caught and displayed using `Fluttertoast.showToast`.

---

### Key Changes in the Code:

1. **Navigation to `VerificationScreen`:**
   - After calling the `createMissedCall` method to verify the phone number, the app navigates to the `/verification_screen` using `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/verification_screen')`.

2. **Verification Screen UI (`VerificationScreen`):**
   - This screen is displayed when the user starts the verification process. It shows a loading indicator (`CircularProgressIndicator`) and a message indicating that verification is in progress.

3. **Back Button Action:**
   - The back button on the `VerificationScreen` will exit the app using `SystemNavigator.pop()`.

---

### What Happens:

1. User enters the phone number and country code.
2. When the user presses "Verify Now", the app starts the verification process using `createMissedCall`.
3. The app then navigates to the `VerificationScreen`, where a loading indicator is shown while the verification process is ongoing.
4. If the user presses the back button, the app will exit.

This documentation will guide users through the steps needed to set up and utilize the `flutter_checkmobi` plugin for phone number verification in their Flutter applications.
